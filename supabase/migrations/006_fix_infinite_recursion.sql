-- Fix infinite recursion in spaces policy
-- The issue: spaces policy references space_members, but frontend joins spaces with space_members
-- Solution: Remove the recursive policy and handle access control differently

-- Drop the problematic policy that causes recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their member spaces" ON public.spaces;

-- Create a simple policy that allows authenticated users to view all spaces
-- Access control will be handled at the application level
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view spaces" ON public.spaces
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Note: This temporarily opens up space visibility, but the space_members table
-- still controls actual access to space content (messages, etc.)
-- The frontend will filter spaces based on membership
